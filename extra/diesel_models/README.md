We'll talk about the history generator.
It may be run punctually to create a Base Seed, and then just for the remaining day until today, then day by day.

We start with simple parameters, about the initial state and wanted final state.
The generator then handles the distribution, and m√πakes sure to have thing realistic and production-like.

In a next version, we can also add more "checkpoints" to the history.
This will allow to generate random environments that are closely similar to production environments 
(without data masking or anything, we just use anonymous subscription metrics)


Flow: 

The HistoryGenerator is creating realistic data from parametors across a specific period

We start with the v1 of all plans, at a specific day
