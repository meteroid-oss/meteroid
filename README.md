## How It Works

Meteroid integrates with your existing systems via a simple API, collecting data on customer usage and interactions.
This data fuels the Meteroid billing engine, applying your custom pricing models to generate accurate, timely invoices.

Our platform simplifies the creation, scaling and maintenance of complex billing models, automates invoice generation,
and provides *clear, actionable insights* for achieving your KPIs.
