## How It Works

Meteroid integrates with your existing systems via a simple API, collecting data on customer usage and interactions.
This data fuels the Meteroid billing engine, applying your custom pricing models to generate accurate, timely invoices.

Our platform simplifies the creation, scaling and maintenance of complex billing models, automates invoice generation,
and provides *clear, actionable insights* for achieving your KPIs.

## For whom ?

Meteroid is designed for startups, SMEs, and enterprises looking to embrace some form of usage-based billing,
product-led growth or re-invoicing.

## Build for Sustainable Growth

Our philosophy is deeply rooted in the principles of open source and open startup culture. <br/>
We believe in **transparency** and **collaboration** as foundational pillars that not only foster innovation but also
build trust and community around our mission.

By choosing Rust as our core technology, we leverage its efficiency, reliability, and safety features, ensuring our
platform is built on a solid, secure foundation.

Our focus on Product-Led Growth (PLG) reflects our commitment to creating products that drive user acquisition,
retention, and expansion through their inherent value and user experience

This approach, combined with our open philosophy, guides us toward creating a more inclusive, sustainable future for the
SaaS industries.
