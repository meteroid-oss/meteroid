Meteroid OSS Helm Chart is provided as a community resource, and is currently not as well maintained as we would like it to be.

If you are considering a production self-hosted deployment of Meteroid OSS or Meteroid Ent and need support from our team, please reach out to us.

If you are using this Helm chart on your own, please be aware of the following current limitations:
- The chart may not be up-to-date with the latest Meteroid releases.
- There will be very limited documentation and support available.

If you encounter any issues while using this Helm chart, please open a Github Issue or feel free to contribute.
